# Euclid's Elements
Written by Euclid in 300 B.C.

## He starts with some **definitions**
most notably:
* A **point** is that which has no part.
* A **line** is that which has no length.
* The **extremeties** of a line are points.
* **Parallel lines** are those which do not meet if extended.

## Then introduces a few axioms
which he takes to be self evident

1) Things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another.
2) The whole is greater than the part. 

## Then come the "postulates"
which are assumptions that Euclid needed as a foundation for his remaining constructions.

1) If you have any two points, you can always draw a line between them.
2) If you have a line, you are always allowed to extend it arbitrarily in either direction.
3) If you have two points, you can always draw a circle whose center is at one point, and whose edge intersects the second point.
4) Any two right angles are the same.
5) If you have a line, and a point not on the line, then there is exactly one line that is parallel to the line that runs through the point. This is called the **parallel postulate**, and famously acts as a gateway to non-Euclidean geometries.
