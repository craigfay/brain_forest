## Method for Comparing Proportions
Put simply, two proportions a:b and c:d are equal if they react identically to multiplication by two arbitrary numbers, m and n. To be sure that a:b = c:d, **all three** conditions below must hold for **any** m and n.

a:b = c:d <=> for any numbers m,n:
	* ma = nb <=> mc = nd
	* ma < nb <=> mc < nd
	* ma > nb <=> mc > nd

This method is significant because it applies even to [[Euclid's Elements |incommensurate proportions]].
