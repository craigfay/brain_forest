As taught by [[Norman J Wildberger]].

Wildberger claims that modern pure math is based on a *fake arithmetic*. 

A number system relies on 3 components:
- A number system, such as natural numbers, fractions, integers, real, and complex numbers.
- Arithmetical [[Operators]].
- Laws of Arithmetic. These laws must be proven!

In practice, modern engineers don't use any of the above. We might call it the **Decimal Floating Point System**, which often uses a [[Mantissa]] and an exponent. (Scientific Notation?) This system necessitates a scheme for managing precision errors, which might include round-off.

Pure mathematicians don't actually any of the systems above either. They extend the definitions to allow for infinite decimal places. The need to incorporate infinities is actually very problematic. [[Simon Stevan]] was the originator of the idea of infinite decimals.

[[Dedicand]] proposed that numbers could be constructed using a **Dedicand Cut**, which represents a 2-tuple, where each element is the infinite set of all real numbers that lie on each side of the target number.

We could also think of numbers as an [[Equivalence Class]] of a [[Cauchy]] Sequence of Rational Numbers. This is an infinite set of infinite sets of rational numbers.

Arithmetic is real numbers is fake, because there is no algorithm to calculate its operations.
