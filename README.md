My personal notes taken using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), which displays connections using a [Graph Representation](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Graph+view).

## Questions
- Why is it reasonable to interpret a vector field as a differentiation operator?
- Why is it reasonable to interpret a Lie Group as a smooth manifold?
- What do we mean when we say that Lie Algebras are constructed from *infinitesimal* group elements?
