# Abel-Rubini Theorem
 As [described by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RdOwhmqP5s) Grant Sanderson

 Using the standard arithmetic operations, there can be no general proof to **quintic equations**, or their higher-order relatives.

 Is it possible that there exists some [[Problems with Contemporary Mathematics|yet unknown]] solution based on different [[Operators]]?

 ## Newton-Raphson Method

 In practice, this isn't a big problem because we have algorithms to approximate solutions with arbitrary levels of precision, such as **Newton's Method**. This is sometimes called the Newton-Raphson method, because in 1690, Joseph Raphson published a simplified version.
 
 You can get a feel for this method by using it to approximate square roots by hand.
