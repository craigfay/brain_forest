## General Ideas
- Research Loom if you get housed
- Your base on Arabia is fully scouted when you have found 3 gold, 2 stone, 2 boars, and 8 sheep.

## Mongols
- You should try to beat mongols in the early game before they get Mangudai / Seige.
- Hunting bonus makes them decent on water.
- They don't really have a Castle age eco bonus.

## Vikings
- Best unit pairings as Vikings are:
	- Beserk / Skirm
	- Arbalest / Siege Ram
	- Pike / Seige Ram
- Vikings should try to win in the mid-game, because their late game isn't super strong.
- As Vikings, know your power spikes (early castle, early imperial), and take advantage of them. Usually going arbalests in early imp is great.
- Its typically best to stay defensive in castle age because you know your fast imperial is coming. Make 1 or 2 more TCs while you wall and build a defensive military. Put the first extra TC on stone if you can.
- Vikings' best opening on land is probably Drush -> Fast Castle
- Beserkers are countered by Arbalest, Heavy Cav Archer, Mangudai, maybe heavy seige.
- On water, Portuguese counter viking longboats with Caravel.
- In team games, Vikings are great on the flank, not that great in the pocket.
- To counter Vikings, maybe choose Britons, Aztecs or Mayans for their ability to keep up with eco bonuses.
- Using Vikings against Mongols, use Skirms and Pikes and raid frequently.
