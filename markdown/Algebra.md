# Algebra
The branch of [[Mathematics]] concerned with finding unknown quantities using known quantities, given equations about their relationships.

## Universal Algebra
In [[Alfred North Whitehead]], published in 1898, the term "universal algebra" had essentially the same meaning that it has today.

Whitehead credits William Rowan Hamilton and Augustus De Morgan as originators of the subject matter, and James Joseph Sylvester with coining the term itself.

At the time structures such as Lie algebras and hyperbolic quaternions drew attention to the need to expand algebraic structures beyond the associatively multiplicative class.

At the time George Boole's algebra of logic made a strong counterpoint to ordinary number algebra.

Whitehead's early work sought to unify quaternions, Grassmann's Ausdehnungslehre, and Boole's algebra of logic. He wrote in his book:

*"Such algebras have an intrinsic value for separate detailed study; also they are worthy of comparative study, for the sake of the light thereby thrown on the general theory of symbolic reasoning, and on algebraic symbolism in particular. The comparative study necessarily presupposes some previous separate study, comparison being impossible without knowledge.*

Whitehead, however, had no results of a general nature. Work on the subject was minimal until the early 1930s, when Garrett Birkhoff and Ã˜ystein Ore began publishing on universal algebras. Developments in metamathematics and category theory in the 1940s and 1950s furthered the field, particularly the work of Abraham Robinson, Alfred Tarski, Andrzej Mostowski, and their students.

## Operads
Algebras are to operads as group representations are to groups. An operad can be seen as a set of operations, each one having a fixed finite number of inputs (arguments) and one output, which can be composed one with others. They form a category-theoretic analog of universal algebra.

Operads originate in algebraic topology from the study of iterated loop spaces by J. Michael Boardman and Rainer M. Vogt, and J. Peter May. The word "operad" was created by May as a portmanteau of "operations" and "monad" (and also because his mother was an opera singer).
