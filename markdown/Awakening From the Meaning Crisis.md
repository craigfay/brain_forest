# Awakening From the Meaning Crisis

## 12 - Higher States of Consciousness
Science depends crucially on **plausibility**, which requires a subject. We use plausibility when we decide which hypotheses are worth testing, which which variables to control, and which conclusions to draw.

The whole of statistics is about finding the answer to one question: "Is my sample representative of the real data I wish to draw conclusions about?"

Neural Networks prevent overfitting by randomly disregarding certain pieces training data. This allows them to generalize well, and be well compressed. This is an example of **disentegration**. (He calls it something different)

A good scientific theory is both highly plausible, and highly applicable. Theories that are highly plausible but narrowly applicable are trivial. Theories that are highly applicable (explanatory) but implausible are conspiracy theories.

Psilosybin is thought to evoke a neural state where integration and dis-integration happen simultaneously.
