# Bosons
These are the particles that we believe are responsible for all of the fundamental forces that we observe in the universe. We would say that they mediate the way that they mediate the interactions of the [[Fermions]] We sometimes call them **force carriers** or **exchange particles**.

## Boson Statistics

Bosons are different than fermions, in that they are allowed to share the same [[Quantum State]]. This produces some very interesting behavior, such as [[Superfluidity]], [[Superconductivity]], and [[Lasers]]. These rules for bosons are called the Boson Statistics, and we think of them as a counterpart to the [[Fermions|Pauli Exclusion Principle]].

All of the fundamental forces we know about come from a host of virtual bosons interacting with real particles. 

Strangely, the rules of boson statistics apply to collections of particles as well. For example, Helium is known as a **composite Boson**, because it has 2 electrons, each with spin 1/2, which add to spin 1, which means that Helium atoms behave like bosons. If you collect a group of helium atoms and cool them into a liquid, they will all inhabit the same [[Quantum State]], and become a [[Superfluidity|superfluid]].

## Composite Bosons
Technically, we say that a boson is anything with a total spin of a whole-integer, such as 0, 1, 2, 3, etc...

## The Higgs Boson
The higgs boson is a special boson with a spin of 0.
