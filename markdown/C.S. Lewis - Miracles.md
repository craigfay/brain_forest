  
*Notes and reflections on "Miracles" [[C.S. Lewis]].*

Ch 1  

Lewis assumes that miracles cannot happen unless there is a supernatural.  

He doesn’t define miracles first, and doesn’t  
  
Ch 2 The Naturalist and the Supernatural  
  
Lewis defines “Miracle” as an interference with nature by supernatural power  
  
If there is no supernatural, there can be no miracles  
  
Naturalists are people who believe that there is nothing that exists besides nature.  
  
They must have a shared definition of nature and super nature  
  
Lewis examines 5 examples of the words nature and natural to conclude that it means “whatever happens without intervention”. The Greek word for nature is physis, which means to grow.  
  
The naturalist believes that there is a completely interlocked system of events in motion. No thorough going naturalist believes in free will.  
  
The supernaturalist believes that one basic thing causes all other things, usually called God.  
  
Naturalism permits of a certain type of God. Nature could create a cosmic consciousness arising from the whole process. Naturalism cannot accept a God that stands outside of nature, and created it.  
  
CH 3 The cardinal difficulty of naturalism  
  
By “naturalism” we mean the doctrine that only nature, the whole interlocked system, exists. This means that nothing could exist that would not be explicable in terms of the system.  
  
If naturalism is true, every finite thing must be, in principle, explicable in terms of the total system.  
  
Lewis spends time describing the supernatural claims of now outdated hypothesis in particle physics or thermodynamics.  
  
All possible knowledge depends on the validity of reasoning.  
  
A strict materialism refutes itself: “If my mental processes are determined wholly by the motion of atoms in my brain, I have no reason to believe that my beliefs are true, and hence no reason to believe my brain to be composed by atoms.”  
  
Thought: Because our senses are reductive, we don’t know what useful signals we haven’t been able to detect. Our information is necessarily incomplete.  
  
CH 4  
  
He thinks that rationality is a rift in nature that points to something beyond or behind nature. He compares this to water lilies on the surface of a scummy pond. They imply roots that emanate from earth below the pond, and that the pond isn’t infinitely deep.  
  
Lewis believes that rationality is invalid if it depends on irrational causes. He claims that this makes an emergent “God” impossible, because it would have been caused by the interactions of atoms, which are not rational.  
  
He believes it is absurd to believe that nature “produced” God, or the human mind. To believe that rationality and nature exist independently (dualism) is impossible.  
  
The only defensible option is to believe that God created nature. This supplies the relationship between them and eliminates the difficulty of sheer otherness.  
  
He finds it very probably that  
  
Chapter 7 enter Luis criticizes Darwinism, and non-objective morality and enter  
  
chapter 6  
  
Louis clears up misgivings  
  
chapter 8  
  
verse talks about lenses, and calls the supernatural the most obvious and forgotten lens  
  
He says that we must go back, or continue onward. To stay here is death.  
  
  
Chapter 7 enter a chapter of red herrings  
  
Chapter 8 miracles a.m. in the laws of nature  
  
  
Luis, Julian discussing difference models force physical laws claims that miracles do not break the walls of physics. He says this because once the miracle occurs do you what is the physics continue to operate just as they did before I forget the effects of America according to the standard laws of physics. What I believe he is missing is that the miracle itself is an instance of the laws of physics being broken. We believe that forces are not applied on their own, and that matter is not introduced or transformed without energy or  
  
  
At the end of this chapter Luis seems to address the idea that what we perceive as miracles may actually just have an expiration within naturalism that we do not understand. It wasn’t clear to me that he addressed it completely or if he was supporting it or criticizing it.  
  
Chapter 9, the chapter not strictly necessary  
  
Lewis explains his emotional obstacle  
  
Critics see Christians as inventing explanations to serve their doctrine. They say that the miracles are actually useful allegories  
  
Lewis’s says that the essential parts of Christianity are miraculous ones.  
  
Lewis recommends two books on symbolism  
  
Ch 10  
  
Horrid red things in poison  
  
Talking is necessarily metaphorical  
  
I grasp your argument  
I see your point  
I am following you  
  
He says we think using mental pictures  
  
Pictures of god that are not anthropomorphic are bound to be more inappropriate. Man is the highest of things that we meet in sensuous experience.  
  
Which vague images of god do I carry?  
  
Mental images are inevitable. We cannot jump off our own shadow.  
  
For modern christians, absurdity in the pictures does not imply absurdity in the doctrine  
  
How do pictures relate to scopes?  
  
Owen Barfield, poetic diction  
  
Edwin Bevins symbolism and belief  
  
  
  
Analysis if these pictures is not the primary concern of the Christian. A drowning man does not analyze the rope that is thrown to him.  
  
Lewis says that the modern literalist is baffled because he tries to find something in the text which is not there. Starting with the modern distinction between material and immaterial, he tries to find out on which side the ancient Hebrew distinction fell. The distinction itself has been made clear only by later thought.  
  
Mr Barfield studies the history of language, and doesn’t think that words began as concrete and were extended to the abstract.  
  
Lewis claims that it is absurd to think that we started with a material idea of god and then spiritualized it.  
  
The Christian doctrines and Jewish doctrines have always been statements about spiritual reality, not specimens of primitive physical science.  
  
This is the difference between explaining and explaining away.  
  
Lewis says that the Christian doctrines which have become metaphorical with the advent of abstract thought mean something which is just as supernatural or shocking after we have removed the ancient imagery.  
  
  
Chapter 14  
  
The grand miracle. If God became man, it was the central event in history  
  
Chapter 16  
  
Miracles of the new creation  
  
Kant: We are prepared to believe in a world with one floor or two, but not many.  
  
The first floor is nature, and the second is super nature  
  
Lewis thinks that the Christian story forces us to believe in intermediate floors.  
  
I have a problem here. Lewis seems to say that the writers didn’t have a way to distinguish historical and metaphorical statements. I find it very implausible that this is true, and that they meant and interpreted every sentence universally. We have a situation now where we’re forced to decide which they intended on a case by case basis because they didn’t specify the character of their claims.  
  
Heaven has several meanings:  
  
  
Who can be trusted with eternal wealth if they cannot be trusted with wealth that parishes  
  
We are given our bodies to manage just as school boys are given ponies to manage  
  
Ch 17  
  
Epilogue  
  
Luis says that the adversary of the whole book is called monism, or perhaps everythingism  
  
The monist thinks that everything is a disguise for something else, the only thing that there is. Luis thinks that this belief is profoundly wrong
