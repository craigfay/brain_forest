# Circle of Fifths

There are 12 different pitches in western [[Music]]. In addition to looking at them in a repeating chromatic (incremental) sequence, we can arrange them into a circle, where each successive pitch is a perfect fifth above the previous pitch (7 semitones). This representation yields a number of surprising insights. (Note the Escher-Penrose-ness of the circle).

`C, G, D, A, E, B, F#, C#, G#, D#, A#, F, C`

## Sharps and Flats
If we imagine moving around the circle in the forward direction, the number of each step also corresponds to the number of sharp notes in the major scale of the root note at that position. For example, `C` has 0 sharps, `G` has 1 sharp, `D` has 2 sharps, and so on up until `C#`, which has 7 sharps.

The same trick works in reverse, where moving backwards (`C -> F, A#, ...`) yields a key with 0, 1, 2 flats, up until B, which has 7 flats.

## Nearness is Consonance

In nearly all music, the most common chords used in a key are the 1, 4, and 5 chords. Notice that the 4 and 5 chords are on either side of the 1. For example, `C` is situated between `F` and `G`. 

Moving adjacently from chord to chord sounds very natural, while moving more than 1 step at a time sounds very strange. **If we want to naturally move from one key to another, we can travel there using adjacent chords on the circle of 5ths.**

## Calculating Transpositions
Some intruments require the musician to do frequent transposition. The circle of 5ths is helpful for doing so quickly.

## Interval Inversions
We know that the major 3rd interval and minor 6 interval are inversions of one another. The interval numbers always add up to 9.

## Geometry of Major vs. Minor

If we examine the notes that comprise a major chord on the circle, we'll notice that the minor quality of the same root can be achieved by doing a mirror image of the major triad; Only one note will change: `C, G, E` -> `C, G, D#`.

## Tritone
Any two notes directly opposite of eachother on the circle form a tritone.

## Distance is Dissonance
Diminished chords are made up of notes that are very far from eachother. Cdim7 is `C, D#, F#, A`. Likewise, augmented chord triads trisect the circle perfectly: `C, E, G#`. These three notes couldn't be further from each other.
