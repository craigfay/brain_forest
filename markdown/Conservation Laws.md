# Conservation Laws
In physics, it appears that there are some quantities that cannot be created or destroyed in physical interactions, namely:

- Energy
- Linear Momentum
- Angular Momentum
- [[Particle Spin]]
- Electric Charge
- Color Charge
- Baryon Number
- Electron Lepton Number
- Muon Lepton Number
- Tau Lepton Number

These laws don't necessarily hold true in [[Relativity|General Relativity]] if space time is changing! **This fact may be an indication of an [[Problems With Modern Physics|error in our model]].**
