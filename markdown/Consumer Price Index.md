# The Consumer Price Index
In the U.S., the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) produces the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is widely used to measure the rate of inflation, and Gross Domestic Product.

Among [[Economics|economists]], there is controversy about the adequacy of the CPI calculation. The calculation has undergone revisions over the years, including a switch from a "Cost of Goods" index to a "Cost of Living" index, which some critics believe is a way for the government to deceptively report lower inflation.
