# Continuity
[[Norman J Wildberger]] believes that the most fundamental [[Problems with Contemporary Mathematics|problem in mathematics]] is how to model continuity. He describes the problem in [FMP19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu-YPJSNFpE.)

This problem is naturally related to ideas in [[Physics]], and is the basis for Algebraic [[Topology]], [[Differential Geometry]], and others. This problem is also related to modern [[Computer Science]].

Many contemporary mathematicians believe that this problem has already been solved, and that the continuum should be modeled using the real numbers, or perhaps a [[Dedicand]] cut or [[Cauchy]] sequence.

Wildberger claims that a full account of the arithmetic of real numbers, and proofs of their arithmetical laws are absent from modern texts, and not possible to construct.

There is a solution that already exists, and actually has its origins with the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]].

Physicists have concluded that there roughly 60 orders of magnitudes of difference between the smallest systems that we can observe, and the largest. Different levels of scale behave quite differently.

A "continuum" is not inherently well defined. For example, lines, curves, planes, time, and space are all potentially different types of continuums.

The ancient Greeks were interested in how to construct a ruler. They had a type of Geometry called [[Affine Geometry]], which is the geometry of a straight edge. This can be combined quite nicely with the notion of parallelism to construct a ruler geometrically using similar triangles. Notice that this requires no notion of curves or even perpendicularity.

The greeks thought of segments as the fundamental unit of arithmetic. 

In the 19th century, [[von Staudt]] and [[David Hilbert]] extended affine Geometry to define addition and multiplication in the context of segments.

Wildberger challenges the viewer to develop an axiomatic framework for arithmetic using affine geometry (in the sense of [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid]]]] instead of [[ZFC]], sufficiently rich to support rational number arithmetic. 

Notice that Affine Geometry does not involve a compass. **Wildberger claims that the compass introduces irrationalities**, which the greeks had a very difficult time incorporating. We still have not solved the same irrationality problems.
