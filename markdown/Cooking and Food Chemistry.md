## Tenderizing Meat with Kiwi
Kiwifruit (and pears) contain an enzyme called **actinidin**, which breaks down protein chains into smaller protein chains. As a result, using kiwi in a marinade will help soften meats. This is especially valuable when the protein being marinated doesn't have a long cook time to soften by other means. This technique was popularized in Korea, where meat is often cookied relatively fast with high heat.
