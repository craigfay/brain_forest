The gods send a flood to destroy mankind. Enki, the god of the underworld sea, warns the the king Ziusudra to build a large boat. *The piece of the myth that presumably describes the boat's design are missing.* A terrible storm creates a flood that rages for 7 days and nights. The sun god Utu appears, and Ziusudra sacrifices an Ox and a Sheep. *Another break in the text occurs.* Ziusudra prostrates himself before the sky god An, and the storm god Enlil, who give him eternal life for preserving the animals and mankind. *The rest of the myth is lost.*
