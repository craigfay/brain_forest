# Determinant
In [[Linear Algebra]], the determinant is an [[Operators|operation]] that tells you the scaling factor of a [[Matrix (Linear Algebra)|linear transformation]]. The determinant will be positive for transformations that that preserve orientation (basis handed-ness), and negative for those that don't. It is sometimes written as |T|.

The determinant vanishes if the matrix is singular.
It is sometimes written as |T|. Remarkably, det AB = det A * det B.
