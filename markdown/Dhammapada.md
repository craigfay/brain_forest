  
DHAMMAPADA  
  
Chapter 1  
  
Hatred does not cease by hatred at any time. Hatred ceases by love. This is an old rule.  
  
He who wishes to put on the yellow dress without having cleansed himself of sin, who disregards temperance and truth, he is unworthy of the yellow dress.  
  
As rain breaks through an unthatched roof, so passion will break through an unreflective mind.  
  
The thoughtless man, even if he can recite a large portion of the law, but is not a doer of it, has no share in the priesthood. He is like a cowherd counting the cows of others.  
  
The follower of the law, only if he can recite only a small portion of the law, but heaven forsaken passion, hatred, and foolishness, possesses true knowledge and serenity of mind. He, caring for nothing in this world, or that to come, has indeed a share in the priesthood.  
  
Chapter 2 - On Earnestness  
  
Earnestness is the path of immortality. Thoughtlessness is the path of death.  
  
Chapter 5 - 8  
  
Chapter 5 - Fools  
  
Long is the night to he who is awake. Long is a mile to him who is tired. Long is life to the foolish who do not know the true law.  
  
Chapter 6 - Wise Men  
  
Do not have evildoers for friends, do not have low people for friends. have the virtuous for friends. Have the best of men for friends.  
  
He who drinks in the law lives happily with a serene mind.  
  
Well makers lead to water wherever they like. Fletchers bend the arrow, and carpenters bend the log of wood. Wise people fashion themselves.  
  
Wise people after they have listened to the law become serene, like a deep, smooth, clear lake.  
  
Whether touched by happiness or sorrow, wise people never appear elated or depressed.  
  
Chapter 7 - The Venerable  
  
There is no suffering from him who has finished this journey and abandoned grief.  
  
Like swans who have left their lake, they left their house and home.  
  
The gods even envy him whose sense, like a horse well broken by the driver, have been subdued. Free from pride and appetites.  
  
Chapter 8 - The Thousands  
  
One word of sense is better than thousands of foolishness.  
  
If one man, in battle conquers a thousand times a thousand men, and if another conquer himself, the second is the greatest of conquerors.  
  
Oneâ€™s own self conquered is better than all other people.  
  
Not even a god can change into defeat the victory of a man who has vanquished himself.  
  
Section 3 (ch 9-14)  
  
Chapter 9 - Evil  
  
If a man commits a sin, let him not sin again.  
  
Even an evildoer sees hapiness as long as he evil deed has not ripened. But when his evil deed has ripened, then does the evildoer see evil.  
  
Let no man think lightly of evil. Even by the falling of water drops, a water pod is filled.  
  
Some people are born again. Evildoers go to hell. Righteous people go to heaven. Those who are free from all earthly desires attain nirvana.  
  
Chapter 10 - Punishment  
  
All men tremble at punishment. All men fear death.  
  
He who seeking his own happiness, punishes or kills beings who also seek happiness, will not find happiness after death.  
  
Do not speak harshly to anybody.  
  
If like a shattered metal plate, thou utter not, than thou hast reached nirvana. Contention is not know to thee.  
  
As a cowherd with a staff drives his cows into the stable, so do age and death drive the lives of men.
