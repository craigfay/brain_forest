## Anubis
God of death, embalming, the afterlife.
By the middle kingdom (c. 2055â€“1650 BC) he was replaced by Osiris as god of the underworld.

He attended the weighing of hearts on scales to judge whether a dead soul could enter the realm of the dead. 

The greeks linked Anubis to Hermes, who guided the dead to the afterlife.

Anubis is very frequently depicted, but isn't involved in any known myth.
