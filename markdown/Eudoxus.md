# Eudoxus

## Method for Comparing Proportions
Put simply, two proportions a:b and c:d are equal if they react identically to multiplication by two arbitrary numbers, m and n. To be sure that a:b = c:d, **all three** conditions below must hold for **any** m and n.

a:b = c:d <=> for any numbers m,n:
	* ma = nb <=> mc = nd
	* ma < nb <=> mc < nd
	* ma > nb <=> mc > nd

This method is significant because it applies even to [[Euclid's Elements |incommensurate proportions]].

## Theory of Exhaustion
An approach to determining area by inscribing polygons. By successively inscribing polygons that occupy more than half of the region they inscribe, Eudoxus knew that it was possible to find an area that approaches some value.
