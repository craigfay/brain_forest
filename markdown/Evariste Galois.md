## Galois Theory
 Galois Theory is devoted to understanding the symmetries of [[Field Extensions]]. Among other results, this theory shows that [angle trisection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_trisection "Angle trisection") and [squaring the circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squaring_the_circle "Squaring the circle") cannot be done with a compass and straightedge. Moreover, it shows that [quintic equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintic_equation "Quintic equation") are, in general, algebraically unsolvable.
