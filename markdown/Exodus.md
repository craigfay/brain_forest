## Chapter 1
The midwives disobey and mislead Pharoah, and God is pleased.

Moses in the papyrus basket is the same idea as the animals on the ark, is the same idea as the son of God in the womb of the virgin Mary.

## Chapter 2
Moses comes into communion with Jethro, a god-like figure because he is a priest and the source of 7 daughters (7 days of creation).

## Chapter 3
Moses is a shepherd, foreshadowing his shepherding of Israel. He encounters the burning bush, is told to perform the miracles.

The staff that turns into a snake, the hand that becomes leperous, the water that become blood all represent something dear and sustaining turning into something unclean and dangerous. Everything that you depend on can turn against you.

The serpent as a staff, the serpent in the tree of life, and the serpent held up on the trident on the wilderness are the same idea.

Pharoah is more than a man, but also a god. The plagues are parodies of other gods in the Egyptian pantheon.
