# Fermions
These are the particles that we believe all matter in the universe is built from. There are two families of fermions: **Quarks** and **Leptons**.

## Pauli Exclusion Principle
Fermions in a group behave very differently than Bosons in a group. Fermions obey a rule called the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which says that Fermions cannot share the same [[Quantum State]]. This is a very important fact, because it is the reason that electrons inside atoms populate all of the energy shells. If it didn't exist, they'd all collapse into the lowest energy state, and electrons would behave very differently. It's the outer electrons in each element that dictates the kinds of chemical bonds that the atom can make, and [[Chemistry]] creates all of the complexity in the universe. **Would chemistry still be possible if electrons all collapsed to the lowest energy state?** Without the Pauli Exclusion principle, all elements would behave similarly to Hydrogen.


## Abstract Fermions
Technically, we say that a fermion is anything with a total spin of a half-integer, such as 1/2, 3/2, or 5/2.
