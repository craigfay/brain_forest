# Fermions
These are the particles that we believe all matter in the universe is built from. There are two families of fermions: **Quarks** and **Leptons**.

## Pauli Exclusion Principle
Fermions in a group behave very differently than Bosons in a group. Fermions obey a rule called the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which says that Fermions cannot share the same [[Quantum State]]. This is a very important fact, because it is the reason that electrons inside atoms populate all of the energy shells. If it didn't exist, they'd all collapse into the lowest energy state, and electrons would behave very differently. It's the outer electrons in each element that dictates the kinds of chemical bonds that the atom can make, and [[Chemistry]] creates all of the complexity in the universe. **Would chemistry still be possible if electrons all collapsed to the lowest energy state?** Without the Pauli Exclusion principle, all elements would behave similarly to Hydrogen.

## Abstract Fermions
Technically, we say that a fermion is anything with a total spin of a half-integer, such as 1/2, 3/2, or 5/2.

## Quarks
Quarks are a type of fermion. They're never found on their own, only in groups with other quarks. We know about 6 types of quarks: Up, Down, Top, Bottom, Charm, and Strange. Like electrons, quarks carry electric charge. Up, Charm, and Top quarks have a charge of 2/3, while the Down, Strange, and Bottom quarks all have a charge of -1/3.

The Top, Bottom, Charm, and Strange quarks are just like Up and Down, except that they have higher masses. They're also unstable. We believe that in the first fraction of a second after the big bang, all the non Up and Down quarks decayed into Up and Down quarks via the weak force. We can still find them in high energy environments like supernovae, neutron stars, or particle accelerators.

A few types of particles formed by quarks:

- Protons: Up, Up, Down (charge 1)
- Neutrons: Up, Down, Down (charge 0)
- Pions: Any 1 quark and its anti-quark counterpart.
- Tetraquarks: Any 2 quarks and their anti-quark counterparts.

Quarks interact with all of the fundamental forces: The electromagnetic force, the weak force, and the strong force. **Would we say that they are part of the strong / weak / EM field?**

## Quantum Field Theory
Claims that there is a field associated with each of the fundamental particles, and that particles are excited states (aka Quanta) of their field.

We say that each force is carried by a field.

## The Higgs Field
The higgs field is a boson that doesn't carry a force, but the quarks, some leptons (electron, muon, tau), and some bosons (W, Z) get their mass from interacting witht the Higgs Field.

## Anti Particles
All fermions have an anti-particle counterpart, who have the same mass, but inverted quanties of charge, baryon number, and other quantum numbers.

## Baryon Number
Any particle consisting of an odd number of quarks is called a **Baryon**. All quarks have a baryon number of 1/3, and all anti-quarks have -1/3. We say that baryon number is a **quantum number**.

## Color Charge
Color charge is a **quantum number**, which is a property of quarks and gluons. It is an important part of the strong force interaction. It is similar to electric charge, but there are 3 different kinds, which we have decided to call Red, Green, and Blue.

A group of quarks that join together to form a proton or neutron must be color neutral. This means that a quark of each color must be present.

Anti-Quarks have anti-color, which we call anti-Red, anti-Green, and anti-Blue.

**Because of color charge, we could say that each flavor of quark actually has 6 sub-types**. All 6 types of quarks can have one of 6 different color charges, making a total of 36 different types of quarks.

## Gluons
Quarks interact with eachother through the strong force, mediated by gluons. There are 8 types of gluons, each representing a different color / anti-color pair.
