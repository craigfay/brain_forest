# Friedrich Nietschze

Responding to the destruction of religion, he predicted that totalitarianism would become extremely attractive to people, especially in its hyper-socialist variants (like communism), and that millions would die in the 20th century as a result. 

He also predicted that nihilism would rise to pathological proportions, because its a polar opposite of totalitarianism. 

He thought that the only solution to this problem would be for humans to transform themselves into meaning creating creatures.

[[Jordan Peterson]] thinks that Nietschze made a mistake in believing that the objective description of reality was correct. He seemed to think that reality itself was dead and meaningless, but that humans could interact with it in a way that made it meaningful.

[[Carl Jung]] was a student of Nietschze, who tried to solve this problem of avoiding nihilism and totalitarianism. Jung took issue with the idea that humans are meaning-creating creatures. He noted that we weren't in control of our relevance-realization mechanism. (The alchemists represented this mechanism as the [[Round Chaos]]).
