## Preface 
The author has forced to be egotistical in order to be sincere.  
  
## Chapter 1: Introduction - In Defence of Everything else  
  
The only possible explanation for this book is that it is an answer to a challenge
  
Mr. G.S. Street was one of the respectable challengers of GK Chesterton‘s book, "Heretics"
  
It was perhaps an incautious suggestion to make to a person only too ready to write books upon The feeblest provocation  
  
How can we at once be astonished with the world and find ourselves at home in it  
  
Note: I believe this is related to the fact that our senses are reductive. We can’t possibly a process all the information that might be available to us at any one time  
  
Chesterton takes as an assumption, the desire for a full and poetic life. We need romance and security.
  
Chesterton is the man in the yacht who thought he was discovering a new island but instead landed in Great Britain.

Chesterton says that he is the fool of the story, and no rebel may throw him from that throne.

He tried to invent a heresy of his own, but invented an inferior version of orthodoxy.

By “orthodoxy “Chesterton means the apostles Creed.
  
## Chapter 2: The Maniac  
Chesterton recalls a conversation with a publisher who said that a man who believes in himself is sure to make it. Chesterton believes that men who believe in themselves after Lee are bound for failure.  
  
This book is a response to the question of what man should believe in instead of himself  
  
Chesterton says that modern people have become unwilling to admit the presence of evil and hell. They are perfectly willing to admit the presence of lunatic asylums, and sanity. He seems willing to substitute these two ideas  
  
Oddities only strike ordinary people they do not strike odd people.
  
Imagination does not breed insanity but reason does.
  
Chesterton says that materialism is complete and completely incomplete. It is much more limiting than any religion.
  
Chesterton believes that it is mysticism that keeps men sane. As long as you have Mystery, you have health.
  
The common man has stereoscopic vision. He sees at once his faith and his free well.. He is free to believe in Gods and to disbelief.  

He admired youth because it was young and age because it was not. This bundle of contradictions has been the buoyancy of the health of man.
  
The Greeks were correct when they made Apollo the god of both imagination and sanity.
  
## Chapter 3: The Suicide of Thought
  
When a religion is shattered, it is not just the vices that run free, but also the virtues and the virtues do a good deal more harm. The virtues have gone mad because they have been isolated from each other.
  
When was meant to be doubtful about himself but certain about the truth. Today this is exactly reversed. 
  
Our second problem is our hopelessness and overactive humility. 
  
Reason, is an active faith. It is an active reason to claim that our thoughts have any bearing on the real world at all.
  
There is a thought that stops that. That is the only thought that must be stopped. H.G. Wells' book "Doubts of the Instrument" is an example of such a thought.
  
Chesterton believes that religion was constructed for the defense of reason, not for an attack on reason  
  
In so far as religion is going, reason is going. By destroying divine authority, we are destroying human authority.
  
Chesterton believes that if evolution destroys anything, it destroys reason. This would be the case if evolution asserts that all there is in the universe is change. 

One might say, I am not, therefore I cannot think.
  
H.G. Wells asserts that every separate thing is unique, and that there are no categories at all.

Beecher started A nonsensical idea, that what men  once saw as bad, they began to aspire to as good.
  
Chesterton is a defender of pragmatism, but believes that there is a form of extreme pragmatism which undermines the idea of truth itself.
  
Chesterton believes that apparent objective truth is not the whole matter  
  
Chesterton believes that the pragmatist must believe in objective truth.
  
Extreme pragmatism is just as inhuman as the determinism that it attacks.
  
Some say that the ultimate authority is in will, not in reason. Nietzsche preached this idea, that Chesterton names egoism. The egoist calls life a war without mercy. The main difference against this perspective is that the egoist thinkers are not thinkers at all. They are makers. (This may be a misquotation)
  
You cannot admire will in general, because the essence of will is that it is particular.
  
An anarchist like Mr. John Davidson has a distaste for for morality space, and therefore he invokes will. He just wants humanity to want something, but what it wants is ordinary morality.
  
All the will worshipers are empty of volition. Every active will is an act of limitation.
  
The moment you step into a world of facts, you step into a world of limits.

Beecher is paralyzed by the like of every option, whereas Tolstoy is paralyzed by the dislike of every option. Joan of Ark has the fierceness of nature and the gentleness of Tolstoy.  
  
## Chapter 4: The Ethics of Elf Land
Chesterton believes that the things common to all men are more important than the things peculiar to any man.
  
Ordinary themes (things?) are more valuable than extraordinary things. 
  
Man itself should be more heartbreaking than any music.
  
Democracy says that all the most important things, like rearing children and choosing partners, must be done by ordinary people themselves.

Tradition is not opposed to democracy. Tradition is just democracy extended through time. Tradition is the democracy of the dead.
  
Chesterton prefers ordinary working class to the literary class that he occupies.
  
Fairyland is the sunny country of common sense.
  
Scientists believe that when one incomprehensible fact follows another incomer they form a single comprehensible relationship.
  
The self is more distant than any star. 
  
The doctrine of conditional joy is the second of the great fairy laws.

All virtue is an "if".
  
The presence of glass and all the fairy tales is an expression of the brittleness of happiness in fairyland.
  
Life itself is as bright as the diamond but as brittle as the window pane. 
  
If Cinderella ask the fairy godmother why it is that she must leave the ball at 12, the godmother could reply, why is that you may stay until 12?
  
Existence itself is so eccentric.
 
The first conviction of fairyland is that this world is a wild and startling place. It might’ve been quite different, but it is quite delightful.

Second, is that before all of this wildness and delight, one may be modest and submit to the queers limitations of so queer a kindness.
  
The regularity of a strange experience does not make it any less strange. If anything it should increase the strangness. 
  
Children have an excess of joy and wonder that causes them to ask adults to “do it again“ until the adult is nearly dead.

It may be that God every morning says to the sun and moon “do it again“.
  
The regularity of nature may be a theatrical encore.
  
Just it and I always believe that the world involved magic but one day he began to suspect that it also involved a magician.
  
Herbert Spencer claimed that men did not resemble God because of his size in relation to the cosmos. If mere size should be an indication of lack of divinity, we should says we should be suspicious because of our relative size to every tree.
 
Chesterton says that the definition of a law is something that can be broken. This is related to [Hard vs. Soft Laws].
  
Anything that can be conceived of as complete can be conceived of as small.
 
Economy is far more romantic than extravagance.

Robinson Crusoe is a romantic story about prudence. The best thing in the book is the list of items that were saved from the wreck.
 
We should see every item in our life as having been saved from a wreck.
 
The fact that there are two sexes and one sun are like the idea that there were two axes and one sword. This Cosmos is without peer and without price.

"I felt in my bones that this world could not explain itself."
  
Magic must have a meaning, and meaning must have someone to mean it. 

Third, Chesterton found this purpose beautiful in its own design, in spite of its defects.
 
Fourth, that the proper form of thanks to it is some form of humility and restraint. 

Fifth, that all good was a remnant to be held secret and sacred out of some primorial...
  
Man had saved his goods as Crusoe had saved his good from a wreck.

## Chapter 5: The Flag of the World  
  
Optimism is patriotism, and pessimism is anti-patriotism.
  
This baptism is transformative when it has no reason, that is to say it is supernatural  
  
Love is not blind it is bound, and the more it is bound the less it is blind  
  
Before a cosmic act of reform we must have a cosmic oath of allegiance  
  
We do not want the good of the world and the evil of the world to nullify each other. We want a fiercer delight and a fiercer discontent  
  
We need to see the world as an ogre‘s castle to be stormed and yet our own cottage to return to  
  
Suicide is the ultimate sin. It betrays are universal loyalty to life.  
  
Chesterton believes that it is foolish to claim that what is valid to believe in one century is inappropriate to believe in another. He says this is like claiming that it is OK to leave one thing on Monday but not on Tuesday. I disagreed and believe that it depends on how different Monday is from Tuesday.  
  
Chesterton believes that Marcus Aurelius is the most intolerant of human types. He is an unselfish egoist. The unselfish egoist is a man who has pride without the excuse of passion. Of all the horrible religions the most horrible is the worship of the God within.  
  
Christianity was unique from these traditions because it insisted that man turn his attention outwards.  
  
Aspects of nature must be appreciated but not worshiped.  
  
Chapter 6: the paradoxes of Christianity  
  
When Christianity is odd, it indicates that there is probably something odd about the truth. In the same way it is odd that a human has a heart on only one side of their body  
  
Chesterton claims that Christians love elaborate Ness of Christianity, just as scientist love the elaborate Ness of science.  
  
Is that it was Huxley and Herbert Spencer and Brad law brought him to Christianity, not apologetics  
  
Just to notice that Christianity was accused simultaneously of being overly optimistic and overly pessimistic. It was too cheery to believe, and two dreadful to stand.  
  
Christianity is criticized for being superstitious, while the critics also claim that culture has a morality of its own. Culture seems to have chosen Christianity.  
  
Ethics changing is made to be both good and bad  
  
Chapter 7: the eternal revolution  
  
Evolution is only good if it produces good. Good is only good if it helps evolution. The elephant stands on the tortoise, and the tortoise on the elephant.  
  
Chesterton discusses the problem of a value system as a precondition for judgment about nature.  
  
Existence r life is privileged in my worldview! Why it anything else?  
  
  
Chesterton denies that Nietz was a strong or bold thinker  
  
NETR always escaped a question by using a physical metaphor. He said beyond good and evil because he did not have the courage to say more good than good and evil or more evil than good and evil. Rather than saying the stronger man or the pure man, he says the upper man.  
  
Some people say that whatever they want is the ultimate aim of evolution. Chesterton believes that these are the only sensible people.  
  
Rather than the word evolution, Chestik prefers the word reform because it implies form, and that we are trying to shape it into the image of something. Reform means that we see a thing out of shape, and we intend to put it into shape.  
  
Chesterton believes that his contemporaries made a huge mistake. They confused to opposite things. Progress should mean changing things to suit our vision, not changing the vision itself.  
  
If a man was in 10th to paint the whole world blue, he would get along very slowly. But if every day he changed his mind about his favorite color, he would not get on at all.  
  
Chapter 8:The romance of orthodoxy  
  
Achieve Mark of our Epok is a deep laziness and fatigue, which is the source of the apparent bustle  
  
Chesterton talks about unwarranted comparisons between Buddhism and Christianity.  
  
Christianity showed us that God himself could be courageous. He was the only black God that doubted himself. In the garden of Eden man doubted God, but in the garden of Gethsemane, God doubted God.  
  
The secularists have not destroyed divinity, but they have destroyed everything else. They will try to cut it guard with a blade that cuts their own fingers, and they will try to burn him with a brand that burns their own house. The Titans did not scale heaven, but they laid waste in the world.  
  
Chapter 9: authority and the adventurer  
  
Christ didn’t conceal his anger but there was something heated concealed. Just to didn’t believe that it was his Mirth.
