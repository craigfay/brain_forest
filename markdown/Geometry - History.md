## History of Geometry
As taught by [[Norman J Wildberger]].

## Part I: Sociology and Pure Mathematics
Because mathematics is so old, it's insightful to understand its origins and sociological history. 

- The first mathematics likely had their origin in the arithmetic of commerce. We haven't discovered anything resembling "number theory" until the greeks in 500 BCE.
- [[Geometry]] has its origins in [[Astronomy]], surveying, and construction. We have evidence for this in the [[Mesolithic]] (10,000 BCE) and [[Neolithic]] (7,000 - 3,000 BCE) periods.
- The earliest theoretical result in geometry probably has to do with the 3-4-5 triangle. They appear in the [[Carnac Alignments]], as well in Sumerian and Egyptian artifacts. [[Howard Crowhurst]] is a credible figure in this subject. This is of course related to the [[Pythagorean Theorem]], which was most famously addressed by [[Euclid's Elements]].

### Astronomy
- Ancients were interested in mapping stars,the motion of the sun, moon, and planets. This was a major preoccupation. These problems had relevance to agriculture and religion.

### Surveying
- Flooding would cause property boundaries to become unclear, and surveying could resolve disputes. 
- [[SI 427]] is a cuneiform tablet which has been studied by [[Daniel Mansfield]], and found to contain very interesting Geometry related to early use of [[Diagonal Triples]].

### Construction
- While written evidence is poor, we have obvious archeological reasons to believe that the [[Egyptians]] had a very sophisticated knowledge of geometry.
- The [[Babylonians]] built largely out of clay, but we suspect that their construction would have rivaled that of the Egyptians.

### Abstract Geometry
The Greeks represent a shift towards interest in abstract mathematics, including:
- [[Platonic Solids]],
- [[Apollonius]]' polarity / duality of [[Conics]]
- [[Thales']] theorem about right triangles inscribed in circles
- [[Pappus' Theorem]], a precursor to non-Euclidean geometry, because it made no use of a compass or curve. This was the first and probably most important theorem in [[Geometry - Projective|projective geometry]]. [[Pascal]] famously generalized this theorem to apply to conics.

### Applied Geometry in Ancient Greece
- [[Erotosthenese]] was the chief librarian in the [[Library of Alexandria]], and probably the world's first great geographer. He was able to calculate distances to the sun and moon by making clever observations about geometry on Earth. This is discuessed in Wildberger's *Famous Math Problems #9*.
- [[Archimedes]] was interested in measurement, and developed formulas for volumes and surface areas of cuboids and spheres. By contrast, Euclid famously avoided measurement. He developed a **Parabola Quadrature Theorem**, (the first major theorem in [[Calculus]]) which is covered in *Famous Math Problems #6*. It says that a parabola implied by a triangle PQR has an area equal to 2/3 the area of PQR.

### Ancient Chinese
- The [[Ancient China|ancient chinese]] were largely interested in astronomy and algebra (solving equations).

### Ancient Indian
- During the [[Indian Vedic Period|Vedic Period]] (1500 - 500 BCE), there are constructed altars that suggest a deep commitment to precise use of geometry. They often used Pythagorean triples.
- The [[Indian Classical Period|Classical Period]] produces lots of astronomical work, including Sine Tables, and [[Brahmahgupta]]'s formula for the area of a cyclic quadrilateral, (whose 4 vertices sit on the edge of a circle). This is a less general counterpart to a formula for the area of a triangle that used to be taught in contemporary math education, but is no longer.

### Islamic / Arabic Period
- 800 - 1500 AD, Islamic mathematicians are concerned with the celestial sphere of the night sky. This has everything to do with [[Spherical Trigonometry]]. [[Buzjani]] was one of several people who developed the [[Law of Sines]], and [[al-Tusi]] introduced the [[Law of Cosines]].
