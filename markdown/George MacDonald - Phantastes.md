# Phantastes by George MacDonald
First published in 1858 in London, *Phantastes* is a fanstasy novel about a young man named Anados, who stumbles into a dream-like world called Fairy Land. The work was heavily influenced by [[Early German Romanticism|German Romanticists]], particularly [[Novalis]]

## Chapter 8 - The Ogre and the Shadow
Anados finds a house in the woods, which is built against the base of a tall tree. Inside, he sees an old woman reading from a book that she holds open with one hand on the table besides her. Anados becomes curious about a door in the house, and the old woman warns him not to enter. He enters anyway, and finds a portal to something like the void. The dark figure of a man glides towards Anados through the portal, and passes through him. Anados spins around, not finding the figure behind him, but the woman tells him that it was his long-searching shadow which has now found him.

## Chapter 9 - The Shadow's Influence
Each place that the shadow rests upon becomes barren and void.

Anados meets a boy who holds a multiplying glass in one hand, and a kaleidascope in the other. *Anados mistreats him in some way?*

He also meets a young girl who holds a mysterious globe, which is apparently precious to her. At first, she insists that he not touch the globe, but admits the touch if very soft. When touched, the globe yields happy vibrations and a soft tone, which increase with the strength of the touch. Anados persists in touching, and wrestles the globe from her hands. In doing, he shatters the globe, which troubles the girl very deeply.

## Chapter 10 - The Desert, the River, the Palace
Anados comes to a rocky desert, inhabited by Goblins. At first sight, they tease him with gestures of feigned worship and offering, but their amusement fades when they see the shadow.

Anados finds a spring cutting through the desert, and decides to follow it. It's banks are increasingly beset by greenery, which increases in the direction that the river leads. At times, the channel continues underground, and Anados must walk on to discover where the water re-emerges. He finds a boat resting on a bank, climbs aboard, and waits while it takes him wherever it will.

"*How much of life's joy do we owe to its intermingled sorrow?*"
