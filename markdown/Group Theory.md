## GL(n, C)
The general linear group ...

## U(n, C)
If we add a condition that the inverse of a matrix must be the hermitian conjugate.

## Lie Groups (Continuous)

Lie Groups are describe symmetries that are continuous, (instead of finite) such as in the case of a circle.

We say that a Lie Group is also a smooth [[Manifolds]], and that its group actions are differentiable.
