# Groupoids
[[Guage Theory|Guage Groups]] live in some kind of space, or set, called a **Groupoid**. We can ask if any two guage fields in this set are **equivalent** under some guage transformation.

We think of a [[Group Theory|group]] as a set of symmetry tranformations that act on a single object.

By contrast, a **groupoid** is the same group, but acting on a collection of objects. *The collection of objects are guage fields, and the group is the set of guage transformations?* Yes. The groupoid is the symmetry group that converts between different guage fields.

We might represent a group mathematically as:

$$
\hat{F}:
	\bigg\{
		\begin{array}{lr}
		  Obj: A_{i} \\
		  Mor: A_{i} \rightarrow A_{j}
		\end{array}
$$
Where
- $Obj$ are the guage fields of the groupoid, indexed by $i$.
- $Mor$ are the guage transformations, or **morphisms** of the groupoid.
