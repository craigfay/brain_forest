# Guage Theories

We would say that the physical quantity "temperature" has different **guages** (also called **guage fields**), such as Kelvin, Celcius, Farenheit. The choice of a guage is arbitrary.

We see that various guages agree with one another by defining **guage transformations**, which translate from one guage to another.

We say that the laws of [[Physics]] have to be unaffected by the guages that we use to describe them. We call this property **guage invariance**, and it is a form of symmetry: Physics is symmetric under an arbitrary choice of guage.

We can describe guage symmetries using [[Lie Groups]]. Our guage fields will be represented as [[Lie Algebras]]. *Is this precise?* The guage fields will be "group valued" objects which transform under a particular representation of a Lie Group.

The guage symmetry acts on these guage fields through a representation of a Lie Group.

**Electromagnetism** can be realized as a guage theory with a guage field which is **U(1)** symmetric, where U(1) represents the 1-dimensional unitary group. We would say that this guage theory is also **Abelian**.

An example of a more complicated guage theory would be **Yang-Mills Theory**. All of the theories that make up the [[The Standard Model of Physics]] are (non-Abelian) Yang-Mills Theories. They are guage theories using the group **SU(N)**. The particular YM theory that describes the standard model is **SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1)**. 

We say that this is the "guage symmetry group of the standard model". This means that the guage fields of the standard model are going to be symmetric under the action of this guage group.

We say that a general Yang-Mills theory is described by non-Abelian groups of the form **SU(N)**.

We can also talk about [[Relativity|General Relativity]] as a guage theory, where the guage symmetry is described by the **Lorentz Symmetry Group**, which is the freedom to choose any coordinate system. This symmetry is given by the group **SO(1,3)**. We say that it gives us the freedom to choose any **Lorentz Frame**; We can rotate or boost to any natural frame.

We also have to respect the so-called **diffeomorphism symmetry**; If we have a manifold, we can arbitrarily change our coordinates, which corresponds to a diffeomorphism of the manifold. Altogether, we would say that GR is characterized by the group **SO(1,3) x Diff(M)**.

When GR is written in its standard form, it looks nothing like a guage theory, but when we use the **Einstein-Cartan Formalism**, which uses **Cartan Geometry**, it does resemble a guage theory.
