# Guage Theories

We would say that the physical quantity "temperature" has different **guages** (also called **guage fields**), such as Kelvin, Celcius, Farenheit. The choice of a guage is arbitrary.

We see that various guages agree with one another by defining **guage transformations**, which translate from one guage to another.

We say that the laws of [[Physics]] have to be unaffected by the guages that we use to describe them. We call this property **guage invariance**, and it is a form of symmetry: Physics is symmetric under an arbitrary choice of guage.

We can describe guage symmetries using [[Group Theory|Lie Groups]]. Our guage fields will be represented as [[Lie Algebras]]. *Is this precise?* The guage fields will be "group valued" objects which transform under a particular representation of a Lie Group.

The guage symmetry acts on these guage fields through a representation of a Lie Group.

**Electromagnetism** can be realized as a guage theory with a guage field which is **U(1)** symmetric, where U(1) represents the 1-dimensional unitary group. We would say that this guage theory is also **Abelian**.

An example of a more complicated guage theory would be **Yang-Mills Theory**. All of the theories that make up the [[The Standard Model of Physics]] are (non-Abelian) Yang-Mills Theories. They are guage theories using the group **SU(N)**. The particular YM theory that describes the standard model is **SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1)**. 

We say that this is the "guage symmetry group of the standard model". This means that the guage fields of the standard model are going to be symmetric under the action of this guage group.

We say that a general Yang-Mills theory is described by non-Abelian groups of the form **SU(N)**.

We can also talk about [[Relativity|General Relativity]] as a guage theory, where the guage symmetry is described by the **Lorentz Symmetry Group**, which is the freedom to choose any coordinate system. This symmetry is given by the group **SO(1,3)**. We say that it gives us the freedom to choose any **Lorentz Frame**; We can rotate or boost to any natural frame.

We also have to respect the so-called **diffeomorphism symmetry**; If we have a manifold, we can arbitrarily change our coordinates, which corresponds to a diffeomorphism of the manifold. Altogether, we would say that GR is characterized by the group **SO(1,3) x Diff(M)**.

When GR is written in its standard form, it looks nothing like a guage theory, but when we use the **Einstein-Cartan Formalism**, which uses **Cartan Geometry**, it does resemble a guage theory.

## Solving Changing Preferences using Guage Theory

Becker bakes **stable preferences** into the definition of economics, because of economists' inability to solve it.

The basis of neoclassical economics depends fundamentally on income and substitution effects. If we extend our current calculus tools in a way that allows us to separate income and substitution effects, you can allow preferences to change.

The solution: Decompose the space into:
- A subspace denoted by $q$, our basket.
- The barter space, $\beta_{p}$ , which is the space of all economically worthless baskets, given the current pricing system, OR all barters given the current pricing system.

The claim is that you can take any vector, and decompose it into the portion of the vector that lies on the subspace $q$, and the portion that lies on $\beta_{p}$. This way, you can allow your vector to change, you can allow changes as the vector moves through time. You keep track of your $q$ subspace, and you allow it to change by barters.

If you look at the size of your vector $v$ relative to your vector $q$, you're going to have a sense of the change in the income, having held substitution effects constant.

Pia Melaney and Eric Weinstein call this an **economically constant** translation.

If you use this method and assume unchanging preferences, all the other index numbers collapse into the Divisia index number.

## Cycling and Other Anomalies


## Abstract
- You have a system which is evolving in a high dimensional space. It is the vector space of products cross the vector space (which is dual to it) of prices. (because every product has a price)
- You have an evolution in the space of products and an evolution in the space of prices simultaneously.
- This could be a consumer price index, or it could be a portfolio.
- You want to have a notion of how much the value of the portfolio has changed over time.
- Since both the prices and the products are changing, you have a problem.
- At any time, there's a space you can move in where the value doesn't change. (The barter space?)
- We want to try to figure out how much the value has changed (as a result of moving around in the 2 high dimensional spaces) by always taking into account how to project out the part which is real change versus the part which is substitution.
- A consequence of doing that is that the evolution is generically path-dependent.
- There is a mathematical formalism which was developed for dealing with these kinds of problems, (where change in the value of something is path-depedent). Mathematicians call it **connections**, physicists call it **guage theories**.
- In some problems, there is a natural choice of this additional structure. The barter space is a natural guage field which we can use.

This whole thing is about maximizing under constraints. That is it. We don't tend to think about Guage Theory as advanced calculus, but it is. It's a calculus that was made to do economics.

It's not about index numbers, its about constancy.

Our current toolkit doesn't solve index number problems between agents or countries.

Curvature is another word for path-dependence.

Foliation is another word for a preference map.
