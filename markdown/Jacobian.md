# The Jacobian
In [[Calculus]], the Jacobian matrix is the best [[Matrix (Linear Algebra)|linear map]] approximating the action of some function *f* at a specific point.

To calculate the Jacobian, we must consider the components of *f*.


## Jacobian Determinant
The Jacobian [[Determinant (Operation)|determinant]] indicates the area scaling factor of *f* near the a specified point.
