## Awakening from the Meaning Crisis

## The Upper Paleollithic Transition

We believe humans have existed in roughly their current biological state for 200,000 years. Humans started doing things they hadn't done before around the upper paleolithic transition, 40,000 BCE. They start making representational art, and probably music. They start making calendars, which improves their hunting abilities, among other things. They start developing thin projectile weapons with bone tips. This requires increased frontal lobe development.

We use the word "project" which implies throwing. Likewise, "subject" and "object" mean thrown-under and thrown-against. All day, we're cognitively throwing. We know that this is a very complex task, in part because training AI to operate projectiles is extremely difficult. This vocabulary is very related to our vocabulary about meaning-making.
