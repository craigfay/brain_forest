# Lie Algebras
In [[Mathematics]], a Lie Algebra is a [[Associativity|non-associative]] algebra formed by the union of:
- A [[Vector Space]] *G*
- An [[Operators|operation]] called the "Lie Bracket"
- An alternating Bi-linear map that satisfies the [[Jacobi Identity]].

## GL(n, C)
The general linear group ...

## U(n, C)
If we add a condition that the inverse of a matrix must be the hermitian conjugate.

## sL(2)

The Lie Algebra sL(2) is the set of 2 x 2 matrices whose [[Trace (Operation)|trace]] is 0. This set has 3 elements that we'll call H, E, and F: (Using row-major ordering)
- H = [1, 0; 0, -1]
- E = [0, 1; 0, 0]
- F = [0, 0; 1, 0]

We can also think of it as being spanned by 3 elements, H, E, and F, whose Lie bracket's are given by:
- [H, E] = 2E
- [H, F] = -2F
- [E, F] = H
