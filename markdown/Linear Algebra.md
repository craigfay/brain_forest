# Linear Algebra
A particular type of [[Algebra]] concerned with linear equations of the form:
`(a1)(x1), ... (an)(xn) = b`

It is used in almost every branch of mathematics and much of engineering, largely because of its ability to efficiently model and calculate observations in the natural world.

[[Non-Linear Systems]] cannot be modeled using linear algebra.
