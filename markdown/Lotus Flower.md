# Lotus Flower

The national flower of Egypt, known to contain [[Psychadelics|Psychoactive]] elements. It is featured in many carvings left behind by the [[Ancient Egypt|Ancient Egyptians]] , who we believe used it to connect with the divine. These images often depict high priests offering the flower to Gods or Pharoahs, while holding the Ahnk, or key / cross of life. The flower is often shown being smoked from a pipe.

Strangely, the priests are usually wearing triangular skirts, with rays emanating upwards from lotus flowers in the lower corners.

Some have theorized that the Eye of Horus also represents the [[Pineal Gland]] which lies at the center of the human brain, and thought to be associated with natural [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] production and dreams. This connection is somewhat strengthened by what looks like the shape of a falcon in its base.
