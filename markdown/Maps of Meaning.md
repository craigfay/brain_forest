*Notes and reflections on "Maps of Meaning" by [[Jordan Peterson]].*
  
## Chapter 1: Maps of Experience  
  
Peterson recalls Nietzsche’s description of the man running into the marketplace to declare gods death  
  
Sumerians did not have a cosmogonic text. The pictograph for the goddess Namu was the same as that for the primordial sea. She gave birth to the sky “An” and earth “Ki”.  
  
These two things were merged in a mystical marriage, and gave birth to Enlil, the god of the atmosphere. In some tellings, Enlil split his parents.  
  
Beth is not a primitive protocience. It is a qualitatively different phenomenon. It is a description of the world as it signifies for action.  
The mythic universe is a place to act not a place to perceive.  
  
Do not understand we do not understand pre-experimental thinking so we explain it away. We think that scientific thought is the only valid form of thought that their ears.  
  
Ancient people seem to have groups things together based on their implications for action.  
  
Action presupposes valuation.  
  
Hidden in Socialism is the will to negate life.  
  
Planned logical rational ideologies often fail because they do not account for the irrational transcendent and ridiculous aspects of human nature  
  
We we have the benefit of the recorded implicit and explicit beliefs of every successful culture that has ever lived. We could use it to build a provisional universal morality.  
  
Meaning is defined by implication for behavioral output.  
  
Peterson implies that a spiritual domain can be thought of as a psychological state.  
  
The domain of the known is the territory we inhabit with everyone who shared our belief. Culture allows people to play games without arguing about the rules.  
  
The basic grammar of transformation mythology appears in the form of “the way”. This is a good example of the metaphorical nature of language.  
  
The metaphoric road haunts both Christianity and Buddhism.  
  
Each generation asks:  
1) What is the current state  
2) What is a better state  
3) What is the process of progressing to the better state  
  
Chapter 2: maps of meaning, three levels of analysis  
  
The brain seems to have adapted itself to the eternal presence of two places: the place where what you think will happen does happen, and the place of novelty. Explored territory, and unexplored territory  
  
The eternal unknown is characterized as an ambivalent feminine character.  
  
The eternal known is typically characterized as predictable and masculine  
  
The eternal Noer is characterized as a mediator between the known and the unknown, and is is often a night who slays the dragon of chaos.  
  
Second analysis  
  
Inconveniences are things that impede our plans. Inconveniences can accumulate and become a catastrophe.  
  
What follows is a provisional and general theory of emotional regulation. Our response to novelty and inconvenience is involuntary.  
  
We respond to novelty by adjusting our behavior and our interpretive schema.  
  
Modern investigation into the role of novelty in psychology began with the Russians. Sokoloff and Vinogradova, Alexander Lorea and Goldberg. Their research stems from Pavlov. They thought that motor output was the critically relevant feature of human existence. They were primarily interested in the role of the brain in governing behavior.  
  
In contrast, western psychologist were mostly interested with determining how the brain apprehend the contents of the external world.  
  
Modern animal experimentalists like Jeffrey Gray have adopted the Russian with thinking with great success.  
  
In the 1950s E. And. Sokolov began research on the reflex basis of attention. By the 1960s, the research had advanced enough for him to formulate the following key propositions: The nervous system can be thought to model the external world by changes in its internal structure. The orienting reflex occurs in response to signals of discrepancy with earlier signals. So love assumed that what we were modeling were facts about the objective world.  
  
Peterson believes that we do model facts, but we concern ourselves with valence or value. Therefore, our maps of the world contain two different types of information: sensory and affective. It’s not enough to know that some thing is, you also have to know what it signifies.
