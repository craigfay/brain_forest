# Marshallian Demand
In [[Economics]], we use **indifference curves** to model a consumer's expected behavior, given their income and preferences. As you move from one indifference curve to a higher one, we say that your utility / welfare is increasing.

**Budget Constraints** represent the market, and the tradeoff between substitutable goods.

Marshallian Demand tells us that consumers maximize by finding the highest indifference curve tangent to whatever budget constraint they're faced with.
