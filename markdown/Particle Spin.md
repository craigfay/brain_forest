# Particle Spin
All elementary particles, and by extension, their composite particles, have a special property called **spin**. We think of it as an intrinsic analog of angular momentum.

Every particle has a [[Wave Function]]. The spin of a particle tells us how that wave function behaves under rotation in 3D space.
- When a particle has spin 1, a single full rotation makes it look the same as it did in the starting position. The sequence of phases looks like `1 -> 2 -> 1`.
- Particles that have spin 1/2 have a phase sequence that looks like `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1`. It only looks the same after 2 full rotations. **What do we mean by rotation here?**

We have conservation laws that say that certain quantities can't be created or destroyed in a particle interaction. Spin is one of these quantities.
