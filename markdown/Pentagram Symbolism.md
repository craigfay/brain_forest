# Symbolism of the Pentagram
As [described by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvwdqaCg-Zg&list=WL&index=5) [[Jonathan Pageau]].

## Symbolism of the Upright Pentagram
Before we understand the inverted pentagram, we must understand the upright. The symbolism of both are completely coherent. 

Appears like a mountain, with a single point that sits above (or rules over) 4 other points. It also looks like a human, with a head at the top and limbs going sidewards and downwards. This reinforces the association with agency (source of action) at the top of the star, and embodiment of action everywhere else. It represents 4 united into 1. The face of the 5 on a regular 6 sided die is a similar representation of 4 being unified by 1.

## Upright Pentagram in the Bible and Christian Art
In the [[Christianity|Chritian]] Bible, The story of the Divine Chariot features a prophetic vision of 4 beasts on the corners of a chariot, atop wheels, carrying the son of man as a rider. This a vehicle for the glory of God to manifest itself.

The ark of the covenant also embodies this pattern.

There is an image called "Christ in Glory", which features 4 glories (4 beasts representing Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John) in the corners, and Christ's haloed head in the top-center. 

Orthodox churches also have 4 corners, painted with pendatives, which transition into columns that support a dome in the center, usually featuring an image of Christ.

## Interpretation of the Upright Pentagram

This symbol is about a multiplicity creating stability. Duality and triality don't have this quality. It also represents the imposition of a single will over others. This is why it is frequently invoked in magical rituals.

## Interpetation of the Inverted Pentagram
Multiplicity is elevated above individuality. The 4 corners are emblematic of a multitude of demons, passions, etc.. This symbol claims that multiplicity can create unity.

The goat king [[Baphomet]] often inscribed in the pentagram implies that that which is cast out has latent power. Pageau claims that this is related to the recently tapped power of minority groups. This is one reason that things like hair and blood are often used in [[Occultism|Occult]] rituals. Pageau calls this the "power of the margin / exception". 

This idea is related to that of democracy, where many wills coalesce into one. It is related to the notion of deriving values from facts, and that the order can emerge from chaos without a unifying will. (Bottom Up). The inverted pentagram is a symbol of refusal to submit to something higher.

Some churches have stained glass which features an inverted pentagram (and often other strange imagery, such as the queen of Shiba, the golden Hemorrhoids.) in the northern transcept. This is because the northern transcept doesn't receive light.

Pageau believes that the dominance of this symbol in our culture is acting as a dark mirror that will call back the presence of the logos.
