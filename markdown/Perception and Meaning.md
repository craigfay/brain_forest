# Perception and Meaning

Through our senses, we perceive a constant stream of information. Even when restricting discussion to a single sense, the task of de-layering the stream of input is non-trivial. We know this because at one time, we can hear sounds from a variety of sources, and distinguish the sources.

We seem to perform this de-layering process by sorting subsets of the stream into categories, or patterns.
