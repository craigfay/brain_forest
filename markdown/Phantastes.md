## Chapter 3 - The Old Woman's Cottage

## Chapter 4 - The Encounter with the Beech Tree

## Chapter 5 - The Cave of the White Lady
	Anodos walks in the woods, and begins to understand the conversations of animals after eating wild fruit from fairy land. **This is akin to the fruit of Eden! He also remarks on the presence of dangerous snakes.** He descends down a rocky hill and into a mossy cave, and reclines on mossy furniture. He sees a relief in the rock that he surmised as Pygmalion. He finds a stone of alabaster that contains a white lady.

## Chapter 6 - The Rusty Knight




## Chapter 8 - The Ogre and the Shadow
Anados finds a house in the woods, which is built against the base of a tall tree. Inside, he sees an old woman reading from a book that she holds open with one hand on the table besides her. Anados becomes curious about a door in the house, and the old woman warns him not to enter. He enters anyway, and finds a portal to something like the void. The dark figure of a man glides towards Anados through the portal, and passes through him. Anados spins around, not finding the figure behind him, but the woman tells him that it was his long-searching shadow which has now found him. He decides that the woman must be the ogre that he was warned about by his previous hosts.

Later in Chapter 10, Anados calls the ogre's house "the church of darkness". 

## Chapter 9 - The Shadow's Influence
Each place that the shadow rests upon becomes barren and void.

Anados meets a boy who holds a multiplying glass in one hand, and a kaleidascope in the other. *Anados mistreats him in some way?*

He also meets a young girl who holds a mysterious globe, which is apparently precious to her. At first, she insists that he not touch the globe, but admits the touch if very soft. When touched, the globe yields happy vibrations and a soft tone, which increase with the strength of the touch. Anados persists in touching, and wrestles the globe from her hands. In doing, he shatters the globe, which troubles the girl very deeply.

## Chapter 10 - The Desert, the River, the Palace
Anados comes to a rocky desert, inhabited by Goblins. At first sight, they tease him with gestures of feigned worship and offering, but their amusement fades when they see the shadow.

Anados finds a spring cutting through the desert, and decides to follow it. It's banks are increasingly beset by greenery, which increases in the direction that the river leads. At times, the channel continues underground, and Anados must walk on to discover where the water re-emerges. He finds a boat resting on a bank, unfastened, climbs aboard, and waits while it takes him wherever it will. Later in the chapter, Anados states that he has chosen all of his directions in fairy-land by following the first thing he finds in motion.

Anados considers that all reflections in mirrors and water are lovelier than the reflected thing itself.

"*How much of life's joy do we owe to its intermingled sorrow?*"

The boat comes upon a palace of fairy-land, and Anados uses an unfastened board (which was acting as a seat) to paddle to shore. Inside, he finds a room labeled "Sir Anados", which contained a perfect replica of his own room. He sits down at a table, prepared for him to dine at, and is waited upon by invisible creatures who serve him whatever he looks towards.

## Chapter 11 -
Anados awakes the next morning to find a new pair of clothes, different than those he is wearing, but in accordance with his preference, and puts them on.


## Chapter 12 - The Story of the Winged Women
Anados reads a book and describes its contents:

In another world, babies are not concieved but discovered. Young women find them in nature, and bring them home to be raised. In this world, women have wings instead of arms, and the appearance of the people is determined by the exact circumstances of their discovery as babies. The color of women's wings changes with the season of their discovery, and the state of the celestial bodies.

The laws of light and reflection are different than on Earth. Instead of being blue at its clearest, the sky is a reflection of the earth below. Instead of a dome, the sky is shaped like the top part of an egg.

Anados enters the world, and lives alongside the creatures. He conveys to them the differences between their worlds, and the women seem embarassed by his vague description of the way that babies come to exist in his world. One of them wanders off, and is found dead the next day.

In the egg world, men and women fall in love with eachother, but instead of being together, go off to die. Anados suspects that when these creatures die, they become children on Earth.

## Chapter 13 - The Story of Cosmo and the Mirror

Cosmo is a young man who is poor, but from a noble family. He is well respected by his peers, but has no close friends. He lives alone in a house that he prefers others do not discover. Cosmo is an expert in arms, and an aquaintence of his is considering a suit of armor for purchase, and asks Cosmo to help determine its value. They enter a dusty antique shop, and the aquaintence buys the suit, validated by Cosmo's valuation.

Cosmo spots an eliptical mirror, and is attracted to it. He leaves the store, but quickly returns to inspect it further. After pretending interest in other items, he asks the shopkeeper to take down the mirror. Its frame is beautifully designed and executed, and seems to posess undiscovered meaning in the figures of its carving. Cosmo asks the price, and is devastated by its unaffordability. The shopkeeper asks Cosmo's name, and reveals that he knew Cosmo's father closely. He offers Cosmo the mirror for 1/4 of it's marked price, under the condition that Cosmo give him first offer if he ever decides to part with the mirror.


## Chapter 17 - The Goblins in the Country of Stone

Anados is mocked by goblins who imitate his song to the White Lady. They pin him down, and taunt him with the possibility that she will choose to be with a better man. They relent when Anados surrenders her to the better man, if he exists.

An evil woman appears to taunt Anados (the terrible mother?). 

## Chapter 18 - The Beach

Anados walks throught the country of stone, which begins to narrow. It becomes so narrow that he must crawl with great difficulty. He sees a light ahead of him, accompanied with nighmares of his childhood. He presses on, knowing that this is his only way out of the country of stone. He emerges onto a wintery beach of rocks that stretch endlessly out of sight.

A cold, deathlike wind chills Anados, and he feels that death is slowly overtaking him. He resigns to use his remaining energy to cast himself into the waves and die of his own choice. He walks out onto a small penninsula and jumps into the water. 

Underneath, he feels a warm embrace, and compares it to being held by the Beech Tree. He floats to the surface, and declines to open his eyes for fear of the waves. He is nudged by a small boat, with fish-like rainbow scales. He climbs inside and puts on a heavy purple cloth. The beach is gone, and the sea has become totally still, and the sky is a perpetual twilight. The stars embrace the waters.

Underneath the waves, Anados sees scenes and faces from his past, but can't convince himself that they're real. He falls asleep, and has dreams of meeting all of his oldest friends. All that have died do not remember death, and all that he has wronged pardon him eagerly.
