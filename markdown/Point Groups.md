# Point Groups
[Point groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_group "Point group") describe symmetry in [[Chemistry|molecular chemistry]], and get their name because they keep at least one point fixed.

Point groups can be represented as sets of orthogonal matrices $M$ that transform point $x$ onto point $y$. $$y = Mx$$
Point groups are sorted into those that are [[Chiralality|chiral]] and those that are achiral. The chiral groups are subgroups of $SO(n)$, which means that all of their transformations are orientation preserving: $\det T = 1$. The achiral groups contain also transformations where $\det T = -1$.
