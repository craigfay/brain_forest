Quaternions are described by $a + bi + cj + dk$, where $a$ is thought of as a scalar, and $bi + cj + dk$ is thought of as a vector.

We can say that the real numbers are embedded in the quaternions, because there is a subset of quaternions (those with a zero-vector part) that are isomorphic to the real numbers.

The field of complex numbers is also isomorphic to three subsets of quaternions.

The real quaternions commute with all other quaternions. In algebraic terms, we would say that they are the **center** of the **ring** formed by the quaternions.

In $\mathbb{H}$ there are infinitely many square roots of $-1$ because the space of solutions is represented by a unit sphere in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$.
