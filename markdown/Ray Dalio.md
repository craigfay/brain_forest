## Principles for Dealing with the New World Order

When central banks print a lot of money, buy stocks, gold, and commodities, because the value of cash is falling, while everybody is using the cash to buy assets.

to understand what is coming at you, you need to understand what happened before you.


In the last couple of years, several important things happened that hadn't happened in Ray's lifetime:
1) Countries didn't have enoughmoney to pay their debts, even after lowering interest rates to zero, so they started printing lots of money.
2) Major social conflicts broke out due to differences in wealth and values.
3) Increasing external conflict between a rising great power and the leading great power. (China and the US)


These three events have all coincided many times before, and nearly always led to changing domestic and world orders.

The last time it happened was between 1930 to 1945. 

An order is a set of governing rules of a country, or the entire world. They often change when a new, strong force defeats a weak old force.

The US internal order was layed out in 1789 when the constitution was created.

Russia changed orders in 1917 during the Russian revolution, which ended in 1991 with a relatively bloodless revolution.

China's new order started in 1949 when the CCP won a civil war.

The current world order, commonly called the American world order, started after the allied forces won WW2. In 1944, the new world monetary system was layed out in the Bretton Woods agreement. This established the US dollar as the leading reserve currency, which should be commonly accepted around the world.

These changes happen in a timeless, universal cycle that Ray calls the "Big Cycle". The biggest examples of this were the Dutch, British, and American empires. All lasted about **250 years** and had **10 - 20 years of overlap**. These overlapping times are marked by great conflict.

Ray thinks that the rise of each of these empires was caused by a specific sequence of events:
1) Better education leads to...
2) Improvements in technology, leads to...
3) More competitiveness, leads to...
4) Better trade,
5) Better military,
6) Financial Centers,
7) Reserve Currency

These trends then decline together.

Each big cycle is split into three parts. The rise, the top, and the decline.

The rise is typically started by powerful, new leaders who win power by gaining more support than their opposition. They consolidate power by defeating the opposition. They establish systems and institutions that make the country work well. They pick their successors well, or make good systems to do so. This is because great empires require many great leaders.

Education is about passing on knowledge, strong character, civility, and work ethic.

The Dutch rose to defeat the Habsburg empire because they were superbly educated. They invented 1/4 of all major technology in their time, including long range ships, and capitalism. The dutch created the first publically traded company: The Dutch East-India Company, and the first stock market. Amsterdam was the world's leading financial center during this time.

Likewise, London and New York were dominant financial centers during the following empires. 

The capitalists, government, and militaries must work well together. The Dutch East India Company was granted a trade monopoly from the government, and had its own officially sanctioned military.

The British followed by a similarly effective British East India Company. The US Military industrial complex did likewise, as does the Chinese system today.

The Dutch "guilder" was the dominant currency, just like the British "pound" or American "dollar", and just like the Chinese "Yuan" may be. Having a reserve currency allows an empire to borrow more than other countries. This increase in borrowing leads to a **financial bubble**.

At the top of the cycle, other nations begin to copy the innovations of the leading nation, and sell them at lower prices. As a people become richer, they also tend not to work as hard. The Golden Era of the Dutch and Victorian Era of the British were like this.

Having an empire becomes unprofitable when it's more expensive to defend than it is productive. This happened to the Dutch when they overextended around the world, and had to conduct several expensive wars.

The US has spent 8 Trillion dollars on foreign wars since September 11.

Richer countries usually get further into debt by borrowing from poorer countries who save more.
