## 13.7 Tensor Representation Spaces; Reducability
Comprehension: 2/5

A **representation space** is a vector space that a family of linear transformations (representing a group) will act on.

Given a group $G$ and its representation space $V$, its *dual space* $V^{*}$ is also a suitable representation space.

A **reducible representation** is one that has a choice of basis for which all the matrices of the representation can be put in the form:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
A & C \\ O & B
\end{pmatrix}
$$
Where $A = p \times p$, $B = q \times q$, $C = p \times q$, with $p, q \geq 1$ for fixed $p$ and $q$.

If the representing matrices all have this form, then the $A$ matrices and $B$ matrices each individually constitute a smaller representation of $G$.

If the $C$ matrices are all zero, we get the case where the representation is the direct sum of the two smaller representations.

A representation is call **irreducible** if it is not reducible (with $C$ present or not).

A representation is called **completely reducible** if we never get the above situation (with non-zero $C$), so that it is a direct sum of irreducible representations.
