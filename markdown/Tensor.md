# Tensor
In [[Linear Algebra]], a Tensor is a number, or collection of numbers, that maintains its meaning under transformations.

If you make a different choice of coordinates, the components of a tensor will change, but in a way that keeps the meaning of the tensor the same.

Tensors have **rank**, which is the number of indices required to access an arbitrary component (element). They also have a **dimensionality**.

## Psuedo-Tensors
If tensors don't maintain their meaning under transformations, we call them **pseudo-tensors**. Angular momentum,
