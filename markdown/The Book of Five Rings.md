# Miyamoto Musashi
According to legend, Musashi was 10 when his father died, and was 13 when he took a man's life with a wooden sword during his first duel.

His legendary rival, Kojiro, was a contender for the title of best swordsman.

## Musashi (Book)
A historical fiction about Miyamoto Musashi, the most renowned swordsman in midieval Japan.

## The Book of Five Rings (or Spheres)
Musashi's first book. At 16, he beat a powerful master named Akayama. At 21, he went to the capital city and met martial artists from all over the country. He dueled many times, and always attained victory. Before age 29, he had won 60 duels, and lost none.

After age 30, he realized that he wasn't victorious because of his superior martial arts, and may have won because of the weakness of his competitors. He subsequently practiced day and night to attain a deeper principle. 

At 50, he spontaneously discovered a science of martial arts. He applies this science to life universally. He doesn't look to other eastern texts for quotation.

"With heaven and canon for mirrors, I take up the brush. At 4am on the 10th night of the 10th month, 1643."

Martial arts are the warrior's way of life. Soldiers must know this way of life. In the present day, there are no warriors with certain knowledge of the way of martial arts.

The way of the warrior is based on excelling others in anything and everything. The true science of martial arts is practicing them in a way such that they will be useful at any time, and teach them in such a way that they will be useful in all things.


## The Dakoto
Musashi's second book, translated as "The Way of Walking Alone"
