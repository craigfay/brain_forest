Curvature has been in relativity for over 100 years, but it has been silently uprooting particle theory in the last few decades.

## The First Revolution

In the 1970s, [[Jim Simons]] and [[Frank Yang]] discover that the classical theory underneath particle physics is as or more geometrical than Einstein's relativity by using [[Norman Steenrod]]'s [[Fiber Bundle|fiber bundles]] and [[Charles Ehresmann]]'s connections (aka Vector Potentials?).

Isadore Singer was considering the work of Jim Simons and Frank Yang, and on the trip from Stony Brook to Oxford, he realized that it was the Quaternionic Hopf Fibration. He realized instantly that the self-dual [[Instanton]] equations (developed by Simons and Yang??) would be a revolution.

[[Roger Penrose]] had a similar insight about how the the Complex Hopf Fibration producing the structure that kickstarted Twistor theory.

## The Geometric Quantization Revolution
Nick Woodhouse discovers that Heisenberg's uncertainty principle relations strangely emerge from curvature. It's related to the "pre-quantum line bundle" (Weinstein says that the terminology is screwed up). What we had previously treated as the annoyance of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle became the beauty of a Geometric Quantum. 
## Geometrical QFT
Graeme Segal discovers that Quantum Field Theory, which is above Quantum Mechanics, and necessary for regimes in which the number of particles changes, would have been discovered by topologists and geometers even if the physical world had never used it, because it was a naturally occuring augmentation of Bordism Theory, which is an enhancement of [[Cohomology]].

How is Dan Quillen involved? He was a student of Raoul Bott, and heavily affected by time around Michael Atiyah. He has a very interesting [Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Quillen). He found determinant lines in Atiyah-Singer Theory which come out of non-local spectral information and building the basis for pre-quantum line bundles in which the functions in that world become the waves that give us QFT (or was it a different theory?). **What's the relationship between the two instances of a pre-quantum line bundle? Or is it the same instance?
