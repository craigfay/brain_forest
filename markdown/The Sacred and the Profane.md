# 3 Realms that Humans Experience
[[Jonathan Pageau]] believes that humans participate in 3 "realms".

## The Public Realm
Things here are orderly and coherant. In well organized societies, most of our experiences take place here.

## The Sacred Realm
Things that are "sacred" have a goodness or beauty that transcends the public realm. This realm is **hidden** in order to protect it from society, because it's inhabitants have society-binding properties. The sacred realm includes profound works of art, historical artifacts or rituals, religious artifacts or rituals.

## The Profane Realm
Things that are "profane" have an ugliness that cleaves society apart. This realm is **hidden** to protect society from it's destructive or disgusting effects. The profane realm includes ideas that are fecal, sexual, viral, or otherwise related to uncleanliness or shame.

## "Nakedness" Analogy
Pageau analogizes these two hidden realms to nakedness: A nakedness of shame, and a nakedness of glory. Both should be covered by garments, and Jonathan makes reference to Judaic stories about nakedness being covered for both reasons.

## How is Swearing Related?
Pageau believes these ideas are relevant to swear-words in language. When humans swear, we often use language from either of these two realms, because they describe sensations that lie outside the ordinary experience. Pageau believes that it is destructive to combine sacred language with profane, because it confuses the two and disorders society. This is strongly related to the effect of [[Post-Modernism|post-modern]] philosophy on art.
