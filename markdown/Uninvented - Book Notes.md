## Introduction


*If God is not the creator of the universe, there must be another explanation for its existence. The only alternatives are materialism or pantheism.*

- Explaining the universe's origin by asserting the existence of a creator seems to defer the problem: Aren't we then culpable to explain the existence of God?
- If we're willing to say that God is the kind of "thing" that exists without being created, we might just as well say that the universe itself might exist without being created.
- Assuming a theistic creator doesn't imply that the creator is the kind suggested by the Bible.


*It is either what it claims to be -- God's inerrant authoritative word, which tells us the truth about the ultimate nature of reality -- or it is make-believe, merely human fiction to one degree or another.*

- Fiction is almost never simple triviality. It's usually a concentration of the most interesting and meaningful types of experiences that humans encounter.
- Even if the bible isn't precisely what it claims to be, it's worth studying and giving attention to.
- The Bible isn't a single type of book, it's an anthology. It doesn't seem appropriate to suggest that it's entirely made up of a description of ultimate reality, because very little of its text seems concerned with the subject. It's partly poetry, partly history, partly laws, partly letters.


## Chapter 1 - The Bible and its Critics
Term: "The Hermaneutics of Suspicion" describes modern people's tendency to regard biblical content with skepticism.

*It isn't necessary to get into the details of [Kant and Hegel's] philosophies, which are terribly complicated; But we can say that their philosophies were purely speculative and gave credibility to the idea that Christianity was possible without revelation.*

- What claims of Kant were purely speculative?
- If Kant's metaphysical system is to be ignored, how does the author suggest that sensibility and understanding are possible?
- If Kant's metaphysical system is to be ignored, what does the author suggest is the appropriate domain of reason?
- What claims of Hegel were purely speculative?

*...Kant and Hegel accepted Hume's naturalistic assumptions...*
- Which assumptions are we discussing, exactly?
