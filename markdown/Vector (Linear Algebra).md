# Vectors
 A vector is a mathematical object that supports [[Operators|addition]], where the sum of any two vectors is subject to [[Associativity]] and [[Commutativity]]. Vectors must also spport scalar [[Operators|multiplication]], which is over a field, typically $\mathbb{R}$, or $\mathbb{C}$, (the real or complex numbers). They are a central object of study in [[Linear Algebra]].

## Vector Space
A vector space is a set of elements *V* that all fit definition above.

## Vector Fields
A vector field is a function $J$ with [[Scalar Field|scalar fields]] as input and output. They can be interpreted geometrically as a family of arrows on some [[Manifolds]] $M$. Vector fields are differentiation [[Operators]], and can be interpreted as the rate of increase of a scalar field $F$ in the direction of the arrows.

## Spaces vs. Fields
Vector **fields** and vector **spaces** are not the same thing.

A vector **space** is a set of possible vectors.
A vector **field** is a map from some set into a vector space.

A vector **space** is something like actual space - a bunch of points.
A vector **field** is an association of a vector with every point in actual space.

A vector **space** you draw as a coordinate system.
A vector **field** you draw as a bunch of vectors all over your space.
