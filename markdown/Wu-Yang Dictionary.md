# The Wu-Yang Dictionary
In 1975 at Stony Brook University, [[Jim Simons]] in the math department was invited to give a series of lectures to professors in the physics department. In the cafeteria between lectures, Simons and ... found that there was a complete correspondence between concepts that had originated in math and concepts that had originated in physics. Shortly after this, Simons disappears and shows up as a billionaire on Long Island. 


## Relevance for Economics
[[Eric Weinstein]] suspects that Simons discovered an insight related to [[Consumer Price Index]].

There is a widely held view among mathematicians that a [[Fiber Bundle]] is a natural geometric concept, since gauge fields, including the electro-magnetic field, are based on geometry. This implies some kind of a miracle: A structure in [[Physics]] has a perfect representation that was introduced for its own beauty in mathematics.

This suggests that if we look at the curvature equations, either linear in the curvature, or taking the derivative of the curvature, somehow we are capturing a tremendous amount of the natural world; By simply finding equations that we find nowhere else, and using them to model of the interactions that we believe to govern our world.

Is there anything comparable in economics?

Let's examine hyper-inflation. A look at Germany in the early 1920s is a good indication that we should have a very good tool for measuring inflation.

Models goods and services with an N-dimensional vector space V over the real numbers. Implicitly, that means we're going to have units for each good, and we're going to be able to get down to fractional amounts of those goods, where a continuum makes sense as a model for those goods.

Q will always be a basket of goods and services. In some cases you'll want to take it to have negative components, but most times we're only concerned with the positive part of the vector space.

Conversely, if you have a unit like the dollar, and attempt to evaluate the price of your basket Q at any given time, what you have is a [[Covector]].

The value of P on Q is simply the inner product given from the vector-space-dual-vector-space relationship.
